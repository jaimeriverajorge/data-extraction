# data-extraction
The following scripts are written to extract data from landmarks of Oak leaves made on the Zooniverse platform. This includes a file to create a class for oak objects, a file to plot points from the landmarks back onto the images, and a file to make a data table for a selected landmark type. 

This is written to be used in LeafMachine 2.0, an updated version of LeafMachine created by Will Weaver, written in Python instead. Work was supported by Dr. Andrew Hipp's lab at the Morton Arboretum Center for Tree Science.
