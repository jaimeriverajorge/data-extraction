For the data with 33 images:
    1. Minor secondary veins: 
        - have 27 maximum points, gives us 54 keypoints
            - output tensor: 54
            - column list must be 55 long, to include image title
        - have minimum of 10 points, gives us 20 keypoints
            - output tensor: 20
            - column list must be 21 (exclusive, up to 20)
            - drop indices 21 - 55
    2. Major secondary veins:
        - have 17 maximum points, gives us 34 keypoints
            - output tensor: 34
            - column list must be 35 long, to include image title
        - have minimum of 7 points, gives us 14 keypoints
            - output tensor: 14
            - column list must be 15
            - drop indices 15 - 35

    3. Major + Minor secondary veins:
        - have major veins first, then minors
        - have maxes of 17 + 27 = 44
            - 88 total keypoints (for max)
        - make one max file with all of them, then:
            - manually drop columns 15-35 and 21 - 53
            - left with 0 - 33, 34 TOTAL KEYPOINTS
        - for min points:
            - output tensor is 34
        - for max points: 
            - output tensor is 88

For the data with 152 images:
    1. Lobes:
        - Have maximum 19 points, gives us 38 keypoints
            - output tensor: 38
            - column list = [''] 
                for i in range(38)
        - Have minimum of 4 points, gives us 8 keypoints
            - output tensor: 8
            - column list must be 9, (exclusive, up to 8)
            - drop indices 9 - 39

    2. Sinuses:
        - Have maximum 19 points, gives us 38 keypoints
            - output tensor: 38
            - column = ['']
                for i in range(38)
        - Have minimum of 4 points, gives us 8 keypoints
            - output tensor: 8
            - column list must be 9, (exclusive, up to 8)
            - drop indices 9 - 39

    3. Blade Tip:
        - have just one point for each image, gives 2 keypoints
            - output tensor: 2
            - column = ['']
                for i in range(2)
