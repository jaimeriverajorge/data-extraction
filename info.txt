1. Minor secondary veins: 
    - have 27 maximum points, gives us 54 keypoints
        - output tensor: 54
        - column list must be 55 long, to include image title
    - have minimum of 10 points, gives us 20 keypoints
        - output tensor: 20
        - column list must be 21 (exclusive, up to 20)
        - drop indices 21 - 55
 2. Major secondary veins:
    - have 17 maximum points, gives us 34 keypoints
        - output tensor: 34
        - column list must be 35 long, to include image title
    - have minimum of 7 points, gives us 14 keypoints
        - output tensor: 14
        - column list must be 15
        - drop indices 15 - 35

3. Major + Minor secondary veins:
    - have major veins first, then minors
    - have maxes of 17 + 27 = 44
        - 88 total keypoints (for max)
    - make one max file with all of them, then:
        - manually drop columns 15-35 and 21 - 53
        - left with 0 - 33, 34 TOTAL KEYPOINTS
    - for min points:
        - output tensor is 34
    - for max points: 
        - output tensor is 88



- with max of 36 and min of 16, dropped 17-37
